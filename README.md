# alvl23countdown



im gonna be completely honest, i have no idea what's going on here chatgpt wrote like 90% of the code. Also I literally dont know how to javascript.


Since this uses https://www.tickcounter.com/ 's widgets as iframes for the timers I had to manually key in every single date and time and subject into the website, as well as the code. This is also why I can't really sort the countdown timers by time. This is unoptimal.

Todo:
Store all the exam dates and information in a easily parsable format (json, sqlite3 or someth). This should allow onboarding of additional subjects to be much easier.
Have the user's javascript calculate the countdown instead of some external service, allowing them to sort in decending order.
Make the website look nicer
